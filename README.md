## Step Size Discussion
If the step size is decreased the wind particles become equally spread out and it's harder to see the trends of the wind lines.
Also the particles move very slowly.
If the step size is increased the wind trend lines become more defined and the speed of the particles increases.
We chose step size 0.15 because it perfectly accentuated the trend lines without merging the particles directly into lines.
